Extracted real-world datasets from Kaggle using the Kaggle API to automate and streamline data acquisition.

Transformed raw data using Python and Pandas by cleaning missing values, standardizing formats, and preparing the dataset for database insertion.

Loaded the processed data into a MySQL database by designing appropriate schema, creating tables, and inserting records using SQLAlchemy for efficient and scalable data storage.
